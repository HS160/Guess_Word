# Number Guessing Game

A simple, interactive number guessing game implemented in Python.

## Description

This game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. The game offers three difficulty levels, each with a different number of allowed guesses:

- Easy: 10 guesses
- Medium: 6 guesses
- Hard: 2 guesses

The game provides feedback after each guess, telling the player if their guess was too high or too low. It also gives a hint when the guess is very close to the correct number.

## Features

- Random number generation
- Three difficulty levels
- Input validation
- Helpful feedback and hints
- Option to play multiple rounds

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
3. Enter your guess when prompted.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number or run out of lives.
5. Choose to play again or exit the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation
